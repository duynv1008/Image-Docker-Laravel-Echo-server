# Image-Docker-Laravel-Echo-server


- Here's the file image field in docker-compose.yml
```bash
    version: '3.8'  # You can use a different version if you prefer
    services:
      laravel_echo_server:
        build:
          context: ./docker/laravel-echo-server  # Path to your Dockerfile or build context
        ports:
          - "6002:6001"
        restart: unless-stopped
```

- In this configuration:
  - `laravel_echo_server` is the name of your Docker service.
  - `build` points to the directory where your Dockerfile and related files are located.
  - `ports` maps port 6001 inside the container to port 6002 on your host machine. You can change the host port to a different value if needed.
  - `restart`: unless-stopped ensures that the container restarts automatically unless it is explicitly stopped by the user.
    
- Make sure that the context path in the build section points to the correct location where your Dockerfile for Laravel Echo Server is located.

- Additionally, you will need a proper Dockerfile inside the ./docker/laravel-echo-server directory to build your Laravel Echo Server image. This Dockerfile should specify the base image, install necessary dependencies, and configure the Echo Server

- Make sure to adjust the Dockerfile based on your specific requirements and project structure. After setting up your docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile, you can build and run your Docker container using the following commands:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
